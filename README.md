This project is part of my bachelor thesis. It's about applying created ML models on certain dataset. 
Firstly I needed to check whether the data that I get were in correct state. 
After that I chose 4 ML models, that are different from each other. It was Logistic Regression, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines and then Naive Bayes.

Source of data come from Football-data.co.uk
